# Project Metrics & Scale Report

This report summarizes the overall scale and volume of the "ScrapMaven" project, covering both source code and data collection.

## 1. Code Metrics (Java)
These figures represent the total development effort involved in building the 6 project modules (Scraping, Preprocessing, ML Model, UI, and Tests).

| Metric                        | Value     | Details                                             |
| :---------------------------- | :-------- | :-------------------------------------------------- |
| **Total Java Classes**        | **31**    | Core logic, UI components, and test suites.         |
| **Total Lines of Code (LOC)** | **4,270** | Combined lines across all `.java` files.            |
| **Project Modules**           | **6**     | Scrapers, Collection, Preprocessing, ML, UI, Tests. |

> [!NOTE]
> The lines of code count excludes external libraries (`lib/`) and generated binary files (`bin/`), focusing solely on the original source code written for this project.

## 2. Data Metrics (CSV)
The following figures represent the volume of data successfully scraped and processed by the system.

| Metric                 | Value      | Details                                       |
| :--------------------- | :--------- | :-------------------------------------------- |
| **Total CSV Files**    | **5**      | Targeted datasets from Cdiscount.             |
| **Total Data Rows**    | **5,307**  | Combined product entries across all datasets. |
| **Avg. Rows per File** | **~1,061** | Density of the scraping output.               |

> [!IMPORTANT]
> The **Total Data Rows** count excludes the CSV header lines (e.g., Title, Price, URL...) to represent the actual number of unique product samples collected.

## 3. Scale Summary
- **Data-to-Code Ratio:** ~1.24 data rows per line of code.
- **Architectural Density:** ~137 lines of code per class on average.
- **Project Complexity:** High (Multi-threaded scraping + custom Machine Learning implementation).
